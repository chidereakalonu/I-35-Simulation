This is a I-35 highway simulation. The purpose is to simulate traffic on the
I-35 corridor through Austin. Each section of road represents one mile â€“ the top
section is the first mile, the next the second, and so on.

    This is an educational repository meant to teach the participants about classes,
    linked lists, and simple computer graphics.
